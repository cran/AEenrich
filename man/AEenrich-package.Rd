\title{AEenrich: Adverse Event Enrichment Tests}
\description{
Adverse event (AE) enrichment
analysis. Unlike the continuous gene expression data, AE data are counts.
Therefore, AE data has many zeros and ties. We propose two enrichment tests.
AEFisher is a modified Fisher's exact test based on pre-selected significant AEs,
while AEKS is based on a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.

Use the function \code{enrich} to fit models and inspect results.

or run ?enrich for examples.

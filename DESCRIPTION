Title: Adverse Event Enrichment Tests
Type: Package
Description: We extend existing gene enrichment tests to perform adverse
    event enrichment analysis. Unlike the continuous gene expression data,
    adverse event data are counts. Therefore, adverse event data has many zeros
    and ties. We propose two enrichment tests. One is a modified Fisher's exact
    test based on pre-selected significant adverse events, while the other is
    based on a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. "Adverse event enrichment
    tests using VAERS" Shuoran Li, Lili Zhao (2020) <arXiv:2007.02266>.
